msgid ""
"To encrypt your home directory or \"Private\" folder, a strong passphrase "
"has been automatically generated. Usually your directory is unlocked with "
"your user password, but if you ever need to manually recover this directory, "
"you will need this passphrase. Please print or write it down and store it in "
"a safe location. If you click \"Run this action now\", enter your login "
"password at the \"Passphrase\" prompt and you can display your randomly "
"generated passphrase. Otherwise, you will need to run \"ecryptfs-unwrap-"
"passphrase\" from the command line to retrieve and record your generated "
"passphrase."
